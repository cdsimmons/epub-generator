# epub generator
The goal of this project is to be able to generate epubs from scraped HTML content.

I made this little tool simply because I like to read a lot of light novels/web novels/wuxia on my Kindle. It's not completely hands free... after the scraper has got all the content setup and ready in the /dist folder, you will need to export to zip file, and change extension from .zip to .epub. If you want to read on Kindle like me, you'll need to convert as well (I normally use [an online converter](https://ebook.online-convert.com/convert-to-mobi)). I'm sure it's possible to do all this too, but I only read this stuff 1 month of a year, so not a big deal for me. 

To get started just type `npm install` into cmd/terminal and once that's completed type `npm run start`.
